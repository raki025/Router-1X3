A 1X3 Router (capable of routing the data packets to three different clients form a single source network) was designed, including a register module that can hold data packets momentarily, to pass onto three different FIFO memories along with a Finite State Machine and a Synchronizer that can manipulate the internal
/The router accepts data packets on a single 8-bit port and routes them to one
of the three output channels, channel 0, channel 1 and channel 2.
